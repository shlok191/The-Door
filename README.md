# Move-It-Game-

This a 2-dimensional game that I made in C++ language when I was 13 years old.
I thought it would be fun to put this on Github.

It uses the SDL graphics library, feel free to download it and read its code! It's in one file and its not that hard to understand.

HOW TO PLAY :-

1. Download The Repository.
2. Put all the files into a folder
3. Run the 'MoveIt.exe' file.
4. Thats it. :)

P.S. Keep in mind, that I just made it for fun and just overlook the fact that the game is very short and
you can finish it in 5 minutes if you try.
